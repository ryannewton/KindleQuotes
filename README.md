## Overview

Kindle Quotes is an app that sends users a daily email with book quotes from their Kindle highlights.

Rather than randomly selecting quotes, the user specifies a book they want to revisit and the app sends quotes in the order they appear in the book. The purpose of this is to help users revisit valuable content to reinforce the lessons.

## Current State

The project is currently only a node.js app that:
-Saves books, users, quotes, and schedules
-Sends quotes at the designated time

Planned features include:
-Scraping a user's Kindle quotes (they must currently be uploaded manually using the /quotes/add endpoint)
-Add a frontend so users can sign up on their own

## About the Author

Ryan Newton is currently a Technical Lead at a software startup. He loves reading and exclusively reads on his Kindle. He has always liked the idea of reviewing his highlights, but found he was never actually did so, so Kindle Quotes was born. This is a side project he works on for fun.
